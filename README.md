# TPM Synchronization Software

This software synchronizes two **TPMs (Tree Parity Machines)** using a user-defined architecture. It also verifies the synchronization through methods based on **matrices** or **hash functions**.

## Features

- **User-defined Architecture**: Allows the user to specify the architecture for TPM synchronization.
- **Synchronization Verification**: Ensures the synchronization between the two TPMs using matrix-based or hash function methods.
- **Flexible**: Supports various configurations and can be adapted for different use cases.
  
## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps to install and run it locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.11 (or the version required by the project)
- Necessary dependencies : random, math, numpy, datetime, json, hashlib and csv


### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/tpm-synchronization.git](https://github.com/MCamps22/SincTPMs.git)
    cd tpm-synchronization
    ```



## Usage

1. **Define the Architecture**: Input your preferred architecture (size, parameters, etc.).
2. **Start Synchronization**: Execute the synchronization process between the two TPMs.
3. **Verify Synchronization**: Choose between matrix-based or hash function methods to verify that the TPMs are synchronized.
